## Deprecation Notice

This repository is deprecated.

When I started writing this code I thought that I could build a program that
would interact with my commit history to build a changelog automatically. This
program would reduce some of the labor required to maintain these repositories,
would incentivize me to produce good commits, and I would even be able to embed
metadata like version numbers and contact information into the commit messages.

The problem with this idea is that in order to create a high quality changelog
the author has to be very structured in how they commit, and each commit
basically has to be its own feature. Git commits have to be more flexible than
that to accommodate all of the ways developers interact with code, and I don't
know how to deal with that flexibility without just writing changelogs by hand
so that is what I will continue to do.
